### Project Description:
A fancy UI for the python maze runner app. This app uses cookies to store the maze and pass them between sessions so it can only handle mazes of 60, 60 safely. Even then occasionally (but rarely) max cookie size errors can occur. If you want to creat larger mazes to solve or check out the original project: https://github.com/icarus612/mazeRunner-PY
